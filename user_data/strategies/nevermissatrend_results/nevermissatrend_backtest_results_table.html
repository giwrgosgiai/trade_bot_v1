            <center>This performance chart tracks results over a certain period, illustrating the success of an activity or project by showing periodic gains or losses and the total outcome over time.</center>
            <img src="00.equity_curve.png" alt="Equity Curve Plot">
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>X-axis</strong> (Time) represents the passage of time, with markers indicating specific intervals for when data was collected or recorded.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Y-axis</strong> (Value) displays metrics such as profits, costs, or other results. It quantifies the outcome for each period and cumulatively.</li>
                <li><strong>Bars</strong> represent values for each time interval. Upward bars show positive results (gains or growth), while downward bars represent negative values (losses or declines).</li>
                <li>The <strong>Cumulative Line</strong> aggregates the values over time, showing the overall trend and total value accrued from the start.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Markers</strong>, like dashed or dotted vertical lines, highlight significant dates or events for reference and provide context for changes in performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reading the Data</strong>: Start from the earliest time point and move forward chronologically. Observe individual bars for short-term performance, and follow the cumulative line to understand the overall trend and total result.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying Patterns</strong>: Look for consistent patterns, such as a series of gains or losses. Noticing how the cumulative line moves can reveal stability, volatility, or trends over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpreting the Outcome</strong>: If the cumulative line ends higher than it started, the net result is positive. If it ends lower, it indicates a negative outcome.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This chart provides an overview of performance trends, helping users understand both short-term results and long-term outcomes.</p>

            <center><h3>Wins / Draws / Losses Plot</h3></center>
            <center>This chart visualizes the <strong>cumulative outcomes</strong> of a strategy over time, showing wins, draws, losses, and overall profit.</center>
            <img src="05.wins_draws_losses.png" alt="Wins / Draws / Losses Plot">
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Time Axis</strong> (Horizontal) represents the progression of the strategy from the start to the end date.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Count Axis</strong> (Vertical, Left) shows the cumulative count of wins, draws, and losses over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Cumulative Lines</strong> (Green for Wins, Blue for Draws, Red for Losses) rise as more outcomes occur, showing the strategy's performance over time.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Profit Axis</strong> (Vertical, Right) tracks the cumulative profit made by the strategy.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Orange Profit Line</strong> indicates whether the strategy is making or losing money cumulatively.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Yellow Dotted Line</strong> marks a special date, highlighting a potentially significant moment for the strategy's performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wins (Green Line)</strong>: A rising green line indicates an increasing number of cumulative wins. The higher this line, the more frequently the strategy has been successful.</li>
                <li><strong>Draws (Blue Line)</strong>: The blue line shows the number of times the strategy neither won nor lost. A steady rise reflects more draws over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Losses (Red Line)</strong>: A rising red line reflects more cumulative losses. A steep rise in this line could indicate a period of underperformance.</li>
                <li><strong>Profit (Orange Line)</strong>: The orange line tracks the total cumulative profit. An upward trend suggests profitability, while a downward trend shows losses.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Date Marker</strong>: The yellow dotted line helps identify significant changes in outcomes or profit that could be related to a specific event.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Reading the Chart:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Start from the left (earlier dates) and follow the lines to the right (later dates) to observe how the strategy's outcomes and profit evolve over time.</li>
                <li>Ideally, both the green line (wins) and the orange line (profit) should trend upward, signaling a successful strategy.</li>
            </ul>

            <center><h3>Combined Equity Curve and Drawdown Plot</h3></center>
            <center>Combines the equity curve and drawdown analysis plots into one figure with two subplots.</br>
            The top plot shows the equity curve, and the bottom plot shows the drawdown analysis.</br>
            Together they show a great overall view on the characteristics of the strategy.</center>
            <img src="12.combined_equity_drawdown.png" alt="Combined Equity Curve and Drawdown Plot">

            <center><h3>Mean Profits & Loss Plot</h3></center>
            <center>The <strong>Average Profit/Loss</strong> line shows the average earnings or losses over a rolling window of time (e.g., 10 periods). Plotted on the secondary (right) vertical axis, this line helps visualize whether the strategy is generating more profits or losses over time. Positive values indicate average profits, while negative values represent average losses.</center>
            <img src="15.mean_profit_loss.png" alt="Mean Profits & Loss Plot">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive values</strong> indicate that the strategy is, on average, profitable during the rolling period.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative values</strong> suggest that the strategy is experiencing average losses over the rolling period.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average Profit/Loss Trends</strong>: Compare the average profit/loss line with the win/loss ratio. A high win/loss ratio alongside a positive average profit indicates both frequent and significant wins. If the average profit/loss is negative despite a high win/loss ratio, it suggests that the strategy is winning more often but losing larger amounts when it does lose.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility</strong>: Large fluctuations in the average profit/loss line can indicate volatility or higher risk, potentially driven by market conditions or strategy behavior.</li>
                <li>This chart provides insights into the <strong>balance between risk and reward</strong>, the effect of large gains or losses, and the overall consistency of the strategy's performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <center><h3>Performance Decay Over Time</h3></center>
            <center>This chart provides an overview of how a strategy's performance metrics evolve throughout the backtesting period, showing <strong>cumulative returns</strong>, the <strong>rolling Sharpe ratio</strong>, and the <strong>win rate</strong>. It also highlights a significant date, such as the "Bull Market Top."</center>
            <img src="75.performance_decay_over_time.png" alt="Performance Decay Over Time Plot">
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>X-axis (Time)</strong> represents the duration of the backtesting period, ranging from the start to the end date.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Left Y-axis (Cumulative Return)</strong> measures the running total profit or loss over time, shown as an orange line.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Right Y-axis (Performance Metrics)</strong> tracks the rolling Sharpe ratio (cyan line) and the win rate (green bars).</li>
                <li>The <strong>Green Bars</strong> represent the win rate, showing the proportion of winning trades relative to total trades for each period. Taller bars indicate a higher win rate.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Cyan Line</strong> represents the rolling Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns over time. Higher values suggest better returns relative to volatility.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Orange Line</strong> shows cumulative returns, providing a snapshot of the strategy's profitability over time.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Yellow Dashed Line</strong> highlights a significant event, such as the "Bull Market Top," allowing for performance analysis around critical moments.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            <ul>
