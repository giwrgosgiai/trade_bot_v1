# Core Coding Standards

## Code Organization
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Follow Python naming conventions:
  - snake_case for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Group related functionality into modules and packages

## Documentation
- Every module should have a docstring explaining its purpose
- Every function and class should have a docstring
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings where appropriate
- Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions

## Documentation Policy
- Never create summary files (*.md, *_SUMMARY.md, README files) unless explicitly requested
- Never proactively create documentation files at the end of conversations
- Focus on code implementation and fixes, not documentation generation
- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks for it

## Imports
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party imports
  3. Local application imports
- Use absolute imports instead of relative imports
- Avoid wildcard imports (*)

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types instead of catching all exceptions
- Include meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Handle cleanup in finally blocks or context managers

## Performance
- Use generators for large data sets
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks

## Security
- Never store sensitive data in code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## File Creation Restrictions
- Avoid creating new files unless absolutely necessary
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create temporary files that aren't cleaned up
- Never create summary or documentation files automatically
